#### Free Food Service (Project)

### Problem Statement:
A lot of food is wasted daily while a lot of people are dying due to shortage of food. Using the technology, we can connect these needy poeple to them who are willing to provide food and mobile phone can be really helpful here.

### Proposed Solution:
This project proposes a "Food Donation System" to help those who are not able to feed themselves for once in the whole day. This will also reduce the wastage of the food. It accepts user details to create an account for them. This application uses Google's Firebase to store and create an account for the user. Any user willing to serve the food can enter the required details to let everyone know about it and the one's who need the service can search for the available service according to the PIN Code of their location.
