#### Free Food Service (Project)

### Problem Statement:
A lot of food is wasted daily while a lot of people are dying due to shortage of food. Using the technology, we can connect these needy poeple to them who are willing to provide food and mobile phone can be really helpful here.

### Proposed Solution:
This project proposes a "Food Donation System" to help those who are not able to feed themselves for once in the whole day. This will also reduce the wastage of the food. It accepts user details to create an account for them. This application uses Google's Firebase to store and create an account for the user. Any user willing to serve the food can enter the required details to let everyone know about it and the one's who need the service can search for the available service according to the PIN Code of their location.

### Functionality & Concepts used :

The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps the user to add or search for the service very easily. Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in the application :
* **Linear Layout** : Most of the activities in the app uses a linear layout, which is easy for the screen to handle.
* **Simple & Easy Views Design** : Use of familiar audience EditText with hints and interactive buttons made it easier for user to register or sign in without providing any detailed instructions pages. Apps also uses App Navigation to switch between different screens.
* **RecyclerView** : To present the available services to the user, the app uses recycler view so that the same view can be reused to show the data on any changes made in the data.
* **Firebase & Live Realtime Data** : We are using Google's Firebase to store the account details with all the security and it's Realtime Database to update the data in realtime so that our users don't miss any updates.

### Application Link & Future Scope :

The app is currently in the Alpha testing phase, You can access the app : [YOUR APP LINK HERE](either Github link or Google Play store link of published app or .apk file).

Once the app is fully tested and functional in GNITS institute, we plan to talk to neighboring colleges also to propose this app idea and collaborate with them on this transportation service. We aim that by next year most of the colleges in our district will use Bus tracking apps to check out their bus routes and be informed all the time. Also we are planning to include emergency SOS features for students traveling in busses if they are stuck somewhere.
